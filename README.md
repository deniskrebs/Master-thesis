Data.zip          =   raw data with 3 columns (Von, An, Date)

core_team_data.R  =   Skript to extract raw data only for the core team (because for others no subproject assigned)

1_LoadData        =   Skript to load and prepare raw data
    
6_1_Centrality    =   Skript for centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness)

6_1_NodeLevel     =   Skript for descriptive analysis on node level (Assortativity, Transitivity, Density, Reciprocity, Average Path length, Diameter

6_1_Communities   =   Skript for community detection (louvain, label propagation, walktrap)

Output timescale  =   Output from algorithm which determins at which time a snapshop of the temporal network should be made

PDFs              =   timescale paper (Detection of timescales in evolving complex networks), second-order networks (Higher Order Aggregate Networks in the Analysis of temporal networks), why louvain algorithm for community detection (Fast unfolding of communities in large networks & A comparative analysis of community detection algorithms on artificial networks), Quantifizieren von Modularit√§t (A network perspective on software modularity)
